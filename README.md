# MapStruct-Lombok
I recently used mapstruct and Lombok in my project, which reduces the amount of mapping of regular similar data structures, such as from the model layer to entity (dao layer); Lombok helps us automatically generate getters, setters, constructors, and so on. It is very convenient to simplify the code and recommend you guys to use it.
